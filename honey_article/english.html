Spend just a few minutes in a garden this time of year, and you will likely see a pollinator buzzing or fluttering from flower to flower. While most of us are aware of this vitally important ecosystem service, the act itself — the transfer of pollen from stamen to stigma via tiny feet, wings, antennas or mouthparts — is largely unseen.

In “Pollination Power,” Heather Angel, a photographer based in Surrey, England, exposes the process in macrophotography, which stands out not only for its range and aesthetics, but also for its scientific exactness: She was determined to show not just creatures in flowers, but the instant release of pollen itself.
Ms. Angel’s pursuits took her to 20 countries, from Kazakhstan to Costa Rica, though some of her most productive trips were closer to home: to her own backyard and to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, in London.

The diversity of plants she captured is equaled only by the diversity of pollinators. “Bees get all the publicity, but there are so many other insects and animals that are important pollinators,” she said. While her photographs include bees and butterflies galore, they also spotlight more unlikely players: hoverflies, scarab beetles, day geckos and blue tits.

Technical expertise made many of the images possible. Ms. Angel used an ultraviolet flash to expose the brilliant petal patterns and fluorescing nectar that many flowers produce for the benefit of their pollinators, normally invisible to the human eye. A red light allowed her to photograph nocturnal moth pollinators.
Plants are not passive players in pollination, and Ms. Angel paid special attention to their role in taking care of business.

Some flowers change color when pollination is complete, signaling to would-be visitors that they should move on to freshly opened blooms. Others open and close to control the timing of the act. All provide some form of enticement for pollinators: sugary nectar, pollen, a place to find a mate or even shelter from the elements.
“Sometimes you see up to five solitary male bees sleeping in a flower,” Ms. Angel said.

Buzzed Honeybees
Caffeinated nectar makes bees more loyal to a food source, even when foraging there is suboptimal.
Caffeine is found in more than morning beverages—scientists estimate that 55 percent of flowering plants also produce caffeine in their nectar, which draws in consumers like honeybees. In a recent study, nectar spiked with caffeine led honeybees to return—and direct their hivemates—to the food source more often than to an uncaffeinated feeder, researchers reported in Current Biology last week (October 15).

A team from the University of Sussex, U.K., led by Margaet Couvillon, trained honeybees to forage from one of two feeders. One provided an average nectar sucrose solution, while the other was spiked with caffeine (though otherwise identical). The researchers tracked the bees with tiny number tags, and saw that honeybees feeding from the caffeinated feeder returned more often, even when the feeder was empty. “These poor bees came back for four or five days afterwards, and they were kind of desperate,” Couvillon told New Scientist. The bees also performed their waggle dance, a behavior used to direct other bees from the hive to the food, more often for the caffeinated feeder.

Caffeine “causes the bee to overestimate the quality of the resource,” Couvillon told The New York Times. The compound entices the bees to visit more often—and therefore collect more pollen from the plant—potentially without the plant actually spending energy to create a higher-calorie nectar. “It’s presumably cheaper for the plant to produce a small amount of caffeine than a large amount more sugar,” study coauthor Francis Ratnieks told BBC News.

“Nature is not big on honesty unless it’s somehow enforced,” James Nieh, a behavioral ecologist from the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved with the study, told New Scientist. “It’s kind of an arms race.”
